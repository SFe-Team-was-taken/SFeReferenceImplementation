<h2 align='center'>Features</h2>

### Easy Integration
- **Modular design:** Easy integration into other projects (load what you need)
- **[Detailed documentation:](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/Home)** With [examples!](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/Usage-As-Library#examples)
- **Easy to Use:** basic setup is just [two lines of code!](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/Usage-As-Library#minimal-setup)
- **No dependencies:** _batteries included!_

### Powerful SoundFont Synthesizer
- Suitable for both **real-time** and **offline** synthesis
- **Excellent SoundFont support:**
- - **Generator Support**
- - **Modulator Support:** _First (to my knowledge) JavaScript SoundFont synth with that feature!_
- - **SoundFont3 Support:** Play compressed SoundFonts!
- - **Can load very large SoundFonts:** up to 4GB! _Note: Only Firefox handles this well; Chromium has a hard-coded memory limit_
- **Reverb and chorus support:** [customizable!](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/Synthetizer-Class#effects-configuration-object)
- **Export audio files** using [OfflineAudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OfflineAudioContext)
- **[Custom modulators for additional controllers](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/Modulator-Class#default-modulators):** Why not?
- **Written using AudioWorklets:** runs in a separate thread for maximum performance, works perfectly in Firefox and Chrome!
- **Unlimited channel count:** Your CPU is the limit!
- **Various MIDI Standards Support:**
- - **MIDI Controller Support:** Default supported controllers [here](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/MIDI-Implementation#supported-controllers)
- - [Full **RPN** and limited **NRPN** support](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/MIDI-Implementation#supported-registered-parameters)
- - Supports some [**Roland GS** and **Yamaha XG** system exclusives](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/MIDI-Implementation#supported-system-exclusives)
- **High-performance mode:** Play Rush E! _note: may kill your browser ;)_
- **Written in pure JavaScript using the WebAudio API:** Supported by all modern browsers!

### Built-in Powerful and Fast Sequencer
- **Supports MIDI formats 0, 1, and 2:** _note: format 2 support is experimental as it's very, very rare_
- **[Multi-Port MIDI](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/About-Multi-Port) support:** More than 16 channels!
- **Smart preloading:** Only preloads the samples used in the MIDI file for smooth playback (down to key and velocity!)
- **Lyrics support:** Add karaoke to your program!
- **Raw lyrics available:** Decode in any encoding! (Kanji? No problem!)

### Read and Write SoundFont and MIDI Files with Ease
#### Read and write MIDI files
  - **Smart name detection:** Handles incorrectly formatted and non-standard track names
  - **Port detection during load time:** Manage ports and channels easily!
  - **Used channels on track:** Quickly determine which channels are used
  - **Key range detection:** Detect the key range of the MIDI
  - **Easy MIDI editing:** Use [helper functions](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/Writing-MIDI-Files#modifymidi) to modify the song to your needs!
  - **Loop detection:** Automatically detects loops in MIDIs (e.g., from _Touhou Project_)
  - **First note detection:** Skip unnecessary silence at the start by jumping to the first note!
  - **Easy saving:** Save with just [one function!](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/Writing-MIDI-Files#writemidifile)
#### Read and write [RMID files with embedded SF2 soundfonts](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/About-RMIDI)
  - **Compression and trimming support:** Reduce a MIDI file with a 1GB soundfont to **as small as 5MB**!
  - **Easy saving:** [As simple as saving a MIDI file!](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/Writing-MIDI-Files#writermidi)
#### Read and write SoundFont2 files
  - **Smart trimming:** Trim the SoundFont to only include samples used in the MIDI (down to key and velocity!)
  - **sf3 conversion:** Compress SoundFont2 files to SoundFont3!
  - **Easy saving:** Also just [one function!](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/SoundFont2-Class#write)
#### Read and write SoundFont3 files
  - Same features as SoundFont2 but with now with **Ogg Vorbis compression!**
  - **Variable compression quality:** You choose between file size and quality!
  - **Compression preserving:** Avoid decompressing and recompressing uncompressed samples for minimal quality loss!

## Limitations
- Synth's performance may be suboptimal, especially on mobile devices.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy `src/spessasynth_lib` to your project.
3. [Use the library](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/Home)

### Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Firefox is recommended for large SoundFonts due to memory constraints. A decent computer is also recommended for handling large SoundFonts.

[Recommended high-quality SoundFont (better than the built-in one)](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1176)

**Requires Node.js**

#### Windows
1. Download the code as a ZIP file and extract, or use `git clone https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth`.
2. Put your SoundFonts into the `soundfonts` folder (you can select SoundFonts in the program).
3. Double-click `start.bat`.
4. Enjoy!

#### Linux
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth
   cd SpessaSynth
   npm start
   ```
2. Put your SoundFonts into the `soundfonts` folder (you can select SoundFonts in the program).
3. Enjoy!

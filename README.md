This repository is essentially 2 programs in one:
# spessasynth_lib
A flexible, powerful, and feature-packed soundfont synthesizer library for the WebAudio API.
Comes with the ability to edit midis and soundfonts!
> [!TIP]
> Looking for a Node.js version? try [spessasynth_core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spessasynth_core)

**[Documentation can be found here](../../wiki/Home)**
## Features
- SoundFont2 Generator Support
- SoundFont2 Modulator Support
- SoundFont3 (vorbis compressed sf2) Support (thanks to [stbvorbis.js](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/stbvorbis.js))
- - Can provide very hiqh quality audio while being relatively light on file size thanks to sf3 support
- Reverb and chorus support (customizable0
- Render audio to a .wav file
- Read and write .mid files
- Read and write [.rmi files with embbedded SF2 soundfonts](../../wiki/MIDI/About-RMIDI)
- Read and write .sf2 files
- A few custom modulators to support some additional controllers (see `modulators.js`)
- Written using AudioWorklets (Firefox and Chrome both work perfectly)
- Can load really large soundfonts (4GB!) (but only on Firefox, Chromium has a memory limit)
- [Multi Port MIDIs support](../../wiki/MIDI/About-Multi-Port) (more than 16 channels)
- MIDI Controller Support (Default supported controllers can be found [here](../../wiki/MIDI-Implementation#supported-controllers)).
- [RPN and NRPN support](../../wiki/MIDI/MIDI-Implementation#supported-registered-parameters)
- Supports some Roland GS and Yamaha XG sysex messages
- High performance mode for playing black MIDIs (Don't go too crazy with the amount of notes though)
- Modular design allows easy integrations into other projects
- Written in pure JavaScript using WebAudio API (Every modern browser supports it)
- No dependencies

## Limitations
- The performance is questionable, especially on mobile devices.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. copy `src/spessasynth_lib` to your project.
3. [Use the library](../../wiki/Home)

# Web app / Local Edition
The complete GUI for spessasynth_lib, allowing remixing experimenting and playing MIDIs in the coolest way possible.

[How to use](../../wiki/How-To-Use-App)
## Features
- Visualization of the played sequence with effects like visual pitch bend and note on effects
- Playable keyboard with various sizes
- Integrated controller for the synthetizer with a lot of options
- Support for lyrics embedded in the file, allowing for karaoke
- Music player mode if you don't like the visualizations
- Mobile friendly ~the ui, not the synthesizer~
- Mutliple languages support, currently: english, polish, japanese
- `Web MIDI API` support (Enables actual MIDI devices to be used with the program)
- [WebMidiLink](https://www.g200kg.com/en/docs/webmidilink/) support
- Play around with the MIDI file, edit instruments controllers and more!
- Render the MIDI file (either modified or unmodified) to .wav
- Export the modified MIDI file to .mid
- Export the trimmed soundfont to .sf2
- Or bundle both as .rmi!
- Comes bundled with a compressed [SGM](https://web.archive.org/web/20130616094125/http://www.geocities.jp/shansoundfont/) SoundFont to get you started
- Also no dependencies!

### Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Firefox is recommended, due to unconstrained memory size.
> Also a decent computer for large soundfonts.

[Recommended high quality soundfont (better than the built-in one)](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1176)

**Requires node.js to be installed**
#### Windows
1. Download the code as zip and extract or use `git clone https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth`
2. Put your soundfonts into the `soundfonts` folder. (you can select soundfonts in the program)
3. Double click the `start.bat`
4. Enjoy!

#### Linux
1. ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth
   cd SpessaSynth
   npm start
   ```
2. Put your soundfonts into the `soundfonts` folder. (you can select soundfonts in the program)
3. Enjoy!

#### todo
- make the worklet system perform good
- port the worklet system to emscripten (maybe) (not really)
- improve the built-in chorus and reverb effects (feel free to suggest improvements!)
- fix release during attack
